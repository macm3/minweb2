Variable annuities, as a class of retirement income products, allow equity market exposure for a policyholder's retirement fund with electable additional guarantees to limit the downside risk of the market. Management fees and guarantee insurance fees are charged respectively for the market exposure and for the protection from the downside risk. We investigate the impact of management fees on the pricing of variable annuity guarantees under optimal withdrawal strategies. Two optimal strategies, from policyholder's and from insurer's perspectives, are respectively formulated and the corresponding pricing problems are solved using dynamic programming. Our results show that when management fees are present, the two strategies can deviate significantly from each other, leading to a substantial difference of the guarantee insurance fees. This provides a possible explanation of lower guarantee insurance fees observed in the market. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate our results.stationary parts of the material well.arthquakes. Based on the results, there is evidence for an earthquake precursory state associated with an increase in spike train dissimilarity as evaluated by a statistical surrogate test.oximately 42% of the entire dataset, when compared with an exhaustive search by the aforementioned FOGSAA, Bag of Words method and the standard LSH implementations. Secondly, the effectiveness of conLSH is demon- strated in action recognition of the video clips, which yields an average gain of 12.83% in terms of classification accuracy over the state of the art methods using STIP descriptors. The last but of great significance is that this article provides a way of automatically annotating long and composite real life videos. The source code of conLSH is made available atthis http URL as those have a significant impact on the freeze-out timescale.
