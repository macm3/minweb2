Abstract: The widespread adoption and dissemination of online news through social media systems have been revolutionizing many segments of our society and ultimately our daily lives. In these systems, users can play a central role as they share content to their friends. Despite that, little is known about news spreaders in social media. In this paper, we provide the first of its kind in-depth characterization of news spreaders in social media. In particular, we investigate their demographics, what kind of content they share, and the audience they reach. Among our main findings, we show that males and white users tend to be more active in terms of sharing news, biasing the news audience to the interests of these demographic groups. Our results also quantify differences in interests of news sharing across demographics, which has implications for personalized news digests.

Title: ALMA Images of the Orion Hot Core at 349 GHz
Autores: M.C.H. Wright, R.L. Plambeck
Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures
Subjects: Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
Abstract: We present ALMA images of the dust and molecular line emission in the Orion Hot Core at 349 GHz. At 0.2" angular resolution the images reveal multiple clumps in an arc ~ 1" east of Orion Source I, the protostar at the center of the Kleinmann-Low Nebula, and another chain of peaks from IRc7 towards the southwest. The molecular line images show narrow filamentary structures at velocities > 10 km/s away from the heavily resolved ambient cloud velocity ~5 km/s. Many of these filaments trace the SiO outflow from Source I, and lie along the edges of the dust emission. Molecular line emission at excitation temperatures 300--2000 K, and velocities > 10 km/s from the ambient cloud, suggest that the Hot Core may be heated in shocks by the outflow from Source I or from the BN/Source I explosion. The spectral line observations also reveal a remarkable molecular ring, ~ 2" south of Source I, with a diameter ~ 600 AU. The ring is seen in high excitation transitions of HC3N, HCN v2=1, and SO2. An impact of ejecta from the BN/Source I explosion with a dense dust clump could result in the observed ring of shocked material.
